**Project Description:**

This is a React based Web app.

There are majorly two screens:
  1. List of People in startwars.
  2. Description of People.
  
I've created few React based componenets such as
"People" and "PeopleDesc"

Hooks Such as useEffect. useState, useParams have been used to get data from api endpoing and manipulation.

Apart from that I've also used React-bootstrap for building a modular and an attractive UI.

This Web app can also be viewed in Mobile screens as I've added size adjustments for different screens.


**Steps to run the code on localhost:**
