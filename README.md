Project Description:

This is a React based Web app.

There are majorly two screens:
  1. List of People in startwars.
  2. Description of People.
  
I've created few React based componenets such as
<People/> and <PeopleDesc/>

Hooks Such as useEffect. useState, useParams have been used to get data from api endpoing and manipulation.

Apart from that I've also used React-bootstrap for building a modula and an attractive UI.

This Web app can also be viewed in Mobile screen and I've added size adjustments for different screens.


Steps to run the code on localhost:
1. Dowload zip file or clone it.
2. write "npm i" command in the terminal.
3. write npm start to run the app on localhost.
